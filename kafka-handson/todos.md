#TODOS:

* add task to create a role binding (e.g. let the producer fail first until the role binding is in place)
* add a task to use the kafka-topics tool to describe a topic (e.g. using a kafka client pod similar to the kafkacat pod)
* expose control center to outside of cluster and add task in controlcenter (e.g. create a file sink connector and monitor what is happening --> consumer group)
